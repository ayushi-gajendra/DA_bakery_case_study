## 📖 Background & Business Case
A South Korean bakery is currently courting a new investor. The investor, influenced by 1980s market trends, is convinced that **Croissants** are the only viable path to success and suggests basing the entire business model around them. 

As a consultant with an entrepreneurial background, I recognized the need to validate this strategy. While stakeholder opinions are vital, basing a business on "gut feeling" introduces significant risk. I conducted this independent market investigation to determine if Croissants are truly the market leader or if a strategic pivot is required to maximize ROI.

## ⚙️ Methodology & Analytical Process
I followed a structured 5-step lifecycle to turn raw transactional data into business strategy.

### 1. Data Integrity & Cleaning (Exercise 0)
I verified the dataset scale to ensure statistical significance.
* **Dataset Size:** 2,421 rows and 31 core features.
* **Cleaning:** Segmented timestamps into hours and days to identify granular patterns.

### 2. Time Trend Analysis (Exercise 1)
I analyzed revenue velocity to solve for operational efficiency.
* **The "Golden Hour":** Revenue peaks at **11:00 AM** (Morning).
* **Weekly Rhythm:** **Sunday** is the highest-grossing day, identifying the bakery as a weekend destination.



### 3. Product Market Fit (Exercise 2)
I tested the investor's "Croissant-only" hypothesis against actual sales volume.
* **The Reality:** **Angbutter** is the dominant bestseller with **3,229 units**, outperforming Croissants (1,049 units) by over 300%.
* **Beverage Synergy:** **Hot Americanos** are the top-selling drink, acting as a critical "anchor" for breakfast orders.



### 4. Hourly Sales Dynamics (Exercise 3)
I analyzed the "Product Mix" to understand how consumer intent changes throughout the day.
* **The Pivot:** Food sales show a **decreasing trend** as the day progresses, while drink sales proportions remain more stable.
* **The Shift:** Drinks make up a higher percentage of the total basket in the afternoon compared to the morning rush.
